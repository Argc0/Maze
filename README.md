# Maze

  A program that is used for creating and solving Perfect Mazes and Braid Mazes (Bonus question) based on the principles of functional programming, using Kruskal and DFS algorithm. It is a project for the course of *Principles of Programming Languages*, which was implemented in the Fall Semester of 2016-2017 by **Ritsogianni Argyro** and **Triantafyllou Leonidas**.    

**_Some examples how to run (using terminal):_**  
  *$ ghci maze.hs*  
  GHCi, version 7.10.3: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help  
  [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( maze.hs, interpreted )  
  Ok, modules loaded: Main.  
  *$ \*Main> runmaze 16 17*  
  *$ \*Main> solvemaze 16 17 (0, 0) (16, 15)*  
  *$ \*Main> printbraid 8 8*  
  *$ \*Main> solvebraid 8 8 (0, 0) (7, 7)*  
  *$ \*Main> printboth 8 8*  
  *$ \*Main> solveboth 8 8 (0, 0) (7, 7)*
